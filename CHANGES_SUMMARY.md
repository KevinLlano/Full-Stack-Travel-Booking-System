# What Changed - SQS Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Made (Won't Break Your App)

### 1. Added AWS SDK Dependency
**File:** `demo/pom.xml`
- Added `software.amazon.awssdk:sqs` dependency (version 2.20.0)
- Used for sending messages to AWS SQS queue

### 2. Created SqsService (Optional Service)
**File:** `demo/src/main/java/com/assessment/demo/services/SqsService.java`
- **Safe Design:** Only activates if AWS credentials are configured
- **Graceful Failure:** Logs errors but doesn't crash your app
- **What it does:** Sends booking notifications to SQS queue

### 3. Updated CheckoutController
**File:** `demo/src/main/java/com/assessment/demo/controllers/CheckoutController.java`
- Added SQS notification after successful order
- **Protected by try-catch:** If SQS fails, order still succeeds
- **Optional:** Only sends if `aws.sqs.enabled=true`

### 4. Updated Configuration
**File:** `demo/src/main/resources/application.properties`
- Added two optional properties:
  - `aws.sqs.enabled=false` (disabled by default)
  - `aws.sqs.queue.url=` (empty by default)

### 5. Created Documentation
**File:** `SQS_INTEGRATION.md`
- Complete setup guide for connecting to Lambda/SQS
- Troubleshooting tips
- Cost estimates

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Guarantees

### Your App WILL WORK Without AWS:
- ‚úÖ SQS disabled by default (`aws.sqs.enabled=false`)
- ‚úÖ Orders complete successfully even if SQS fails
- ‚úÖ No AWS credentials required for normal operation
- ‚úÖ Try-catch blocks prevent crashes
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback if AWS SDK not initialized

### Your App WILL WORK With AWS:
- ‚úÖ Automatically sends booking notifications to SQS
- ‚úÖ Lambda processes messages asynchronously
- ‚úÖ Doesn't slow down order processing
- ‚úÖ Logs success/failure for monitoring

## üöÄ How to Use This

### Option 1: Keep It Disabled (Default)
- Do nothing! Your app works exactly as before
- SQS code is dormant and won't execute

### Option 2: Enable Later (After Deploying Lambda)
1. Deploy Lambda + SQS infrastructure (`aws-lambda` folder)
2. Update `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   aws.sqs.enabled=true
   aws.sqs.queue.url=YOUR_QUEUE_URL_FROM_TERRAFORM
   ```
3. Configure AWS credentials (locally or in Fly.io)
4. Restart your app
5. Orders now send notifications to Lambda!

## üìã Next Steps

### To Deploy Without SQS:
```bash
# Just deploy as normal - SQS code won't run
fly deploy
```

### To Deploy With SQS (Later):
1. Read `SQS_INTEGRATION.md` for complete setup
2. Deploy Lambda infrastructure (`aws-lambda` folder)
3. Configure AWS credentials in Fly.io
4. Update `application.properties` and redeploy

## üß™ Testing Locally

### Without SQS (default):
```bash
cd demo
mvn spring-boot:run
# Make a test booking - works normally, no SQS messages sent
```

### With SQS (after setup):
```bash
# Set properties
aws.sqs.enabled=true
aws.sqs.queue.url=https://sqs.us-east-1...

# Run app
mvn spring-boot:run

# Make a booking and check Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/travelapp-booking-processor --follow
```

## üí∞ Costs

- **Without SQS:** $0 (nothing changes)
- **With SQS:** ~$0-5/month (very low cost for learning)

## ‚ùì Questions?

### "Will this break my current deployment?"
No! SQS is disabled by default. Your app works exactly as before.

### "Do I need to deploy Lambda/SQS now?"
No! You can deploy Lambda whenever you want to learn about serverless.

### "Can I remove this if I don't want it?"
Yes! Just:
1. Remove SqsService import from CheckoutController
2. Remove `sqsService.sendBookingMessage()` calls
3. Remove AWS SDK from pom.xml

### "What if I deploy without configuring AWS?"
Your app works fine! SQS code detects missing credentials and skips execution.

## üéØ Summary

You now have:
- ‚úÖ Spring Boot app with **optional** SQS integration
- ‚úÖ Lambda + SQS infrastructure ready to deploy (Python)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation and setup guides
- ‚úÖ Safe, fail-graceful design
- ‚úÖ Works with or without AWS

**Nothing will break your current Fly.io deployment!**
